4. Experimentation

## Bootstrapping

Self-referentially applying my principles to themselves...

1. Transparency: What are my principles?
2. Authenticity: Am I living by my principles? Do my actions go against my principles?
3. Intention: Am I living by my principles? Is my decision making informed by my principles?
4. Experimentation: Are there other principles out there I should include?
